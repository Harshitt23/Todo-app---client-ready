## Todo app
Now in this we are making a Simple todo application 
it has the fllowing features -
-anyone can create a todo.
-anyone can see their existing todos.
-anyone can make a todo as done.

##Start
   ##First things first we are creating this application without vite , so we will not be 
   installing - { npm create vite@latest } ,, so we will not be getting any css file any, structure to start, any react code.
   we will create every file and folder, structure, css - ourself.

(1) Start with making a readme.md

(2) make a backend folder and do { cd backend } - bcz we will be installing our node packages and express in
    that folder

(3) initialize anode project now ~ just do { npm init }
    //it will put a package.json file
   image.png

(4) now we will do { npm install express } ` we will be using express in our project
    it will load all node modules and packages

(5) Now we create a file named -  index.js in the backend folder
    and write //write bsic express boilerplate code.
              //with express,json() middleware

(6) Now make a file inside backend ~ types.js in which there will zod inputs we will expect 
    from our end user. to initialize ~ { npm install zod }
